Trip Sorter - Readme
====================

Summary
-------

This application is intended to sort a list of un-ordered boarding passes where
the start and end point are not known for the whole trip and for each boarding 
pass in the lowest possible order of complexity (Big O notation).


REQUIREMENT
-----------
PHP version 5.6.
PHPUnit 5.7.19 to run tests only 

  
INSTALLATION
------------
No special requirements, Copy the folder PropertyFinder to your /var/www/html 
directory, and then you can run the application by accessing the URL 
http://localhost/PropertyFinder/


ASSUMPTIONS
-----------

1- During traveling you will not pass by your start and your end more than once, 
for example If I am traveling from point A to D, my route will be A to B, B to C, 
C to D, I will not pass through A and D more than once.
2- You will also not pass by any point more than once
3- No validation was made through the code, it is considered that the JSON will 
be submitted correctly and holds the correct data.
4- I would love to discuss this with you more even if it is not correct and I am 
not considered as a candidate.
